# ZUNI

## The problem ZUNI - DID on Flow solves
ZUNI tackles the challenges of centralized identification and traditional KYC processes that compromise user privacy.

By utilizing Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) based on W3C specifications, ZUNI enables users to take control of their identity and disclose only necessary information.

With the power of zk-SNARKs, credentials can be efficiently verified without exposing sensitive data. This innovative solution provides secure, privacy-preserving identity verification, giving users peace of mind and control over their personal information. Say goodbye to unnecessary data disclosures and welcome a new era of self-sovereign identity with ZUNI.

## Challenges we ran into
### 1. Integration Complexity and Time Constraints:
One of the main challenges we encountered was the complexity of integrating different components into a seamless system. The integration process required careful coordination and thorough testing, which took more time than initially anticipated. We had to ensure that all the functionalities of ZUNI, including DID and VC support, worked seamlessly together, resulting in a robust and reliable self-sovereign identity application.

### 2. Lack of Mobile ZKP Support:
While the zk-SNARKs protocol is a powerful tool for ensuring data privacy, we faced a significant hurdle in finding suitable support for generating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) directly on mobile devices. As a result, we had to explore alternative solutions and devise workarounds to achieve the desired level of privacy and security while maintaining efficient verification on mobile platforms.

Overcoming these challenges has been a crucial part of our journey in building ZUNI, and we are continually working to refine and optimize the application for a seamless user experience across both web and mobile platforms. Our dedication to providing a secure, privacy-focused identity solution has driven us to overcome these obstacles and deliver an innovative and impactful product.
